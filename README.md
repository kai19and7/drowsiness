# Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset

This repository provides the datasets supporting the study: *“Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Facial Landmarks and Embedded AI”*. 

The dataset features high-fidelity behavioral modeling of **115 diverse subject profiles**, designed to evaluate driver state under both controlled conditions and representative nighttime driving scenarios. It is optimized for the development and validation of robust monitoring systems in embedded environments.

## Dataset Contents
The dataset provides synchronized visual, behavioral, and physiological indicators structured for fatigue analysis:

* **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):** High-frequency measurements and blink rate dynamics.
* **Head Pose Parameters:** Pitch, yaw, and roll values extracted via precise facial landmark mapping.
* **Behavioral Indicators:** PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure) and simulated steering deviation values representing performance impairment.
* **Demographic Representation:** Diverse subject profiles to ensure model generalization across different facial characteristics.

## Key Features
* **Optimized for Embedded AI:** Data formats are structured for low-latency processing and resource-constrained environments.
* **Environmental Diversity:** Scenarios include varied lighting conditions with a focus on high-risk nighttime driving representations.
* **Privacy-Centric Design:** All data is provided as processed numerical features and behavioral metrics, ensuring full privacy without compromising research utility.

## Usage
These datasets are intended for academic research on driver monitoring systems (DMS), fatigue analysis, and the advancement of embedded computer vision algorithms.
